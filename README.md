# helloreact
my first react project
## Notes
#### to install npm (and nodejs):
first : install nvm (google is your friend)

then:

`nvm install node`

npm is now installed under `~/.nvm`

make sure to update it using : `npm i -g npm@latest`

npx allows for an easy local install to get started with [expo-cli](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/#install)
